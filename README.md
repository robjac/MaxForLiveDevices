# MaxForLiveDevices
All Max For Live devices I make and am willing to show to the world


#ChordPitcher

This is a Max for Live audio effect that can repitch a sound to 4 different ratios in real time(from -48st to 48st). 
So you can add this effect over a monophonic synth and make it play a chord instantly. 

All of this is automatable.
It also features some built in chord presets, these presets use the first voice as root note.
Also it has a seperate frequency shifter for each voice.

One thing to note is that the device can have a bit of latency when the used ratios are very large.

#Tails

This is a device that automatically records its input whenever you pause Ableton. Effectively recording the tails of your Live set. This way you can save your beautiful audio tails and reuse them in creative ways. 

I recommend putting this device on your master channel.

You can save a file to .aiff .wav and some other formats by pressing the "Save buffer" button after recording a tail. This will open a folder selector window.
